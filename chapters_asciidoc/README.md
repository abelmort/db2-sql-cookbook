In this folder we save all chapters of the book. They are numbered and will come together as one document in the order of the numbers, i.e, the number of the file determines the order in the book.

Writing conventions:
+ always write the text in English
+ keep it simple and stupid
+ use the Db2 sample database for your examples

If you insert code, tag it as follows:

    [source, sql]  
    ....  
    SELECT ...  
    ....  

If the output of your statements renders as a table, align all the columns to give them a better readability as text, for example:

    |===
    |Column1        |Column2|Column3
    |ValueVeryLong  |Val    |-
    |===
  
... more to come
